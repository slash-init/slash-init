# Hi, I'm Gaurav 👋

I’m a second-year Computer Science student who enjoys building web applications and understanding how systems work end to end. I’m currently learning full-stack development and like turning ideas into practical projects that solve real problems. Outside development, I spend time listening to music and watching movies or TV series.
